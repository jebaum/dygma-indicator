A simple CLI utility to get the battery level of Dygma keyboards.

Because only one process can use the serial port at a time, this app is designed to run, get the battery level, print it to standard output, and exit immediately.

It is designed to work with status bars like `waybar`, but its simple JSON output makes it easy to integrate with other tools and scripts.

## Installation

This tool is mainly intended for and tested on linux, but it may work on other platforms as well!

### AUR

On Arch linux you can use the AUR `dygma-indicator-bin`

### Go Install

#### Latest version

`go install github.com/coolapso/dygma-indicator`

#### Specific version

`go install github.com/coolapso/dygma-indicator@v1.0.0`

### Linux Script

It is also impossible to install on any linux distro with the installation script

#### Latest version

```
curl -L https://dygma-indicator.coolapso.sh/install.sh | bash
```

#### Specific version

```
curl -L https://dygma-indicator.coolapso.sh/install.sh | VERSION="v1.1.0" bash
```

### Manual install

* Grab the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/coolapso/dygma-indicator/releases).
* Extract the binary
* Execute it

> [!NOTE]
> macOS support uses the same USB enumeration as Linux now, but it's tested less. Report issues if you hit them.

## Usage

At the moment there's nothing speciall about it, just execute it and it will print the battery level to standard output.

```bash
dygma-indicator
```

### output


The application outputs a JSON object with the battery percentage and a corresponding text status.

```json
{"text":"L:50% R:70%","tooltip":"Left side: 50%\nRight side: 70%","percentage":50}
```

- `text` shows per-side state: `L:NN%` for a discharging side, `L:CHG` when charging, `L:OFF` when the side is off / out of range, `L:?` if the firmware reports an unknown state.
- `tooltip` is the human-readable equivalent, one line per side.
- `class` is one of `unknown`, `critical`, `disconnected`, `charging`, `error` (the tool itself failed — text will be `?`), or absent (omitempty). Listed in precedence order; style via waybar CSS.

### Waybar

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/coolapso/dygma-indicator/blob/main/img/waybar.jpg">
</p>

To use this with `waybar`, add the following configuration to your `config` file.

```json
  "custom/keyboard": {
    "format": "{icon}   {text}",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 3600,
    "format-icons": [
      "󰂃",
      "󰁻",
      "󰁾",
      "󰂀",
      "󰁹"
    ],
    "max-length": 40,
    "escape": true,
    "exec": "dygma-indicator"
  },
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The serial protocol used by the keyboard can only be used by one application at a time. It is recommended to set a reasonably high `interval` (e.g., 3600 seconds) to avoid blocking other applications like Bazecor when you need to use them.

# Troubleshooting

### Permission denied / "could not open port"

On Linux you usually need to be in the `dialout` group (Debian/Ubuntu) or `uucp` group (Arch). Run `sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER`, then log out and back in.

### Finding the device path manually

If discovery fails, check whether the OS sees the keyboard at all. Linux: `ls /dev/serial/by-id/` should show a Dygma entry. macOS: `ls /dev/cu.usbmodem*`.

### `error: port busy` or it works once and then never again

Something else is holding the serial port — Bazecor, a stale serial monitor, or a previous run of this tool that crashed without releasing it. Close them. This is also why the waybar config above uses `interval: 3600`; don't drop it lower or you'll block Bazecor when you try to use it.
